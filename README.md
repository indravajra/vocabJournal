A vocabulary journal created using the [Glossary Page Template](https://github.com/hilverd/glossary-page-template). It's hosted on GitHub Pages and automatically committed and pushed via [Gitwatch](https://github.com/gitwatch/gitwatch).

This journal serves as a repository for intriguing words I encounter, regardless of the language they originate from.

Special thanks to [hilverd](https://github.com/hilverd) for providing this solution. It's exactly what I was searching for, as opposed to my previous method of creating individual Markdown files for each new word on my [wiki](https://idravajra.github.io/cyber-samadhi).

```shell
sed -n '/START OF editor.js$/,$p' index.html | FILE=index.html node
```
